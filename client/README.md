## App organization:

App organization follows the fractal structure:

1. Each component and it's corresponding reducer & action & initialState are all put under the same folder
2. The container and presentational components are under the same JSX file for each component
3. Root reducer is in the parent folder of the components folder

## Framework and Technology:

React with Redux, animation by Popmotion's Pose.
